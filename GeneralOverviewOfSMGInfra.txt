#General Overview about SMG Infrastructure
##Referring to the document “DevOps Computer Setup and Important Links”.
1.	VMWare ESX
•	There are 2 V centers CH (Chicago) & KC (Kansas City ) backup in case of power outage or something. Where all the servers are located.
•	One of the data centers can be logged using email address. While the other one can be done using only the username.
•	In the v centers we have list of resources like java files, EPM, Jenkins and API endpoint
2.	EPM 
•	Mainly used for application logs.
3.	Mesh Linux Server
•	We have a list of mesh servers in the v center. We can SSH in to those using the password credentials in the keypass file.
•	The format of the SSH command would be $ssh username@mesh_server_id (i.e – ch-api-mesh01-p).
•	Linux boxes are on centOS – 8.
4.	Prometheus & Graphana
•	Monitoring boxes with high CPU load
5.	API
•	Severals API like SVC (used for backend services), WEB (Frontend API for office 365), Auth API (used for authentication purposes).
6.	Rabbit MQ
•	Several queues setup for all the stages. Test, Dev, Prod Stage environment.
•	URL: rmq.smg.com & (incase for internal use internal.rmq.smg.com) use the same format for dev, test, stage and prod.
7.	Several deployed services for the company like stat, structure, text, translation and so on.
8.	AWS
•	We have 11 AWS accounts. The main 2 are smg-shared-prod (Production Account) and smg-shared-non-prod (Stage Account)
•	smg sandbox account is used mainly to test something out we need.
•	smg auth account is mainly used to IAM users that we have.
•	On our stage account we are running everything that we have on dev, test and stage.
9.	Team Foundation Server (TFS)
•	There are some old infrastructure on TFS which are not moved to github. However can be moved to Github.
10.	Octopus
•	There are some pipelines for EMS that are pushed to octopus.
•	We have a whole section for EMS Which have several services like EMS configuration detection, import services, Response Manager, Schedule Manager and service APIs.
•	We can refer to the confluence link for more details : https://smg-software.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EMS/overview.
•	Explained different redis clusters on octopus used to cache various application data.
11.	Jira Tasks
•	Explained the Kanban board.
•	Explained the SMG request center with different request use cases.
•	Explained other Jira functionalities 
12.	We have a format of IP addresses that helps us understand whether it’s in an internal network or external network.
If the IP have 10. X.X.X. it means it is hosted in an internal network and. 10.20. X. X means it is hosted in Chicago (CH) and 10.60. X. X means it is hosted in Kansas City (KC). We can check the IP address by pinging like (i.e : ping resource_id) on the powershell.
